    <p>The parish church of St Ives is dedicated to a 5th-century Irish saint named Ia the Virgin, who is said to have been carried across the Irish Sea on a leaf.
	The church was built of granite between 1410 and 1434 and is one of the most beautiful churches in Cornwall.
	
	It was built as a chapel of ease and only became the parish church in 1826.
	
	The tower is one of the highest in Cornwall, standing over 80 feet tall and acting as a beacon from the town and sea.
	It is built of granite quarried near Zennor. A south aisle was added to the building by the Trenwith family around 1500.</p>

	<h2> St Nicholas Church </h2> 
	<br>
	St Nicholas is not only the patron saint of children, but also of sailors,
	and it is natural to assume that the latter is the reason for the dedication of this little chapel,
	standing as it does on the top of the Island,
	surrounded on three sides by the sea in this town where our ancestors have for centuries derived their livelihood from the sea.
	
	Unfortunately, there is no record of it being built,
	but mention has been made that there was a stone chapel on the Island before St Ives Parish Church was built in 1434.
	It could be conjectured that a wooden structure was built at this place at the time when Irish missionaries made their pilgrimage to Rome in about the fifth century, 
	but there is no evidence to support this.
