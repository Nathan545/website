    <p>St Ives is a town in Cornwall, England, known for its surf beaches, like Porthmeor, and its art scene.
	The seafront Tate St Ives gallery has rotating modern art exhibitions, focusing on British artists. 
	Nearby, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, in the modernist artistâ€™s former studio, displays her bronzes and other works.
	Boat trips go to Seal Island, just west of town, to see the seal colony.</p>
	
	<p>St Ives takes its name from an Irish princess and missionary called St Ia. 
	According to legend St Ia sailed from Ireland to Cornwall on a leaf in the 5th Century. 
	St Ia built an oratory on what is now the site of the St Ives Parish Church. 
	During the reign of King Henry V in the early 1400s construction of the church began, taking 16 years to complete and was finally consecrated in 1434.</p>

           <p>St Nicholas is not only the patron saint of children, but also of sailors,
		   and it is natural to assume that the latter is the reason for the dedication of this little chapel, 
		   standing as it does on the top of the Island, surrounded on three sides by the sea in this town where 
		   our ancestors have for centuries derived their livelihood from the sea.</p>
